# IBM-Project
The SmartSDLC project is an AI-driven platform designed to make the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) faster, smarter, and more efficient. By combining technologies like IBM Watsonx, FastAPI, LangChain, and Streamlit, it automates many of the time-consuming tasks in software development.

With SmartSDLC, teams can:

Upload PDFs to automatically extract and structure requirements.

Convert natural language prompts into working code.

Generate test cases and documentation instantly.

Fix bugs with AI-driven suggestions.

Get real-time help through an intelligent chatbot.

The platform balances power with simplicity. Its backend, built on FastAPI, ensures smooth and secure API processing, while the frontend, developed with Streamlit, delivers an interactive and easy-to-use dashboard. SmartSDLC is scalable, modular, and secure, with built-in authentication and seamless integration between AI models and user inputs.

Deployment is straightforward with Uvicorn and Streamlit, and developers can easily explore the system through Swagger UI’s comprehensive API documentation.

By automating repetitive tasks and providing AI-powered support, SmartSDLC minimizes manual effort, accelerates development, and improves software quality—making it a powerful ally for developers and project teams alike.
